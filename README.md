# Reinforcement Learning from scratch CartPole solver with Pytorch

This is the solver of the Reinforcement Learning Environment named CartPole.

I ran this code several times and it took from 10000 to 40000 steps to solve this environment.

To improve performance the env.render() may be commented but it turns off the visualization of the environment.

I spent very little time on hyperparameter tuning. I think it may be solved faster if spend some time on tuning.
